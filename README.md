## About this
This simple app was born because I always missed calls when in battery saver with vibration mode enabled, but why? Because Google thinks that vibration consumes so much juice it is a good idea to disable it completely when the battery is low. While this is understandable, they should also consider that the phone won't ring, so how do you find out someone is calling?

To fix this simply install the app and follow the instruction to enable Accessibility access and you will get your vibration back ðŸ¤©.

## Development
Pull the main repo, make the appropriate changes, then compile it using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Should work out of the box.
