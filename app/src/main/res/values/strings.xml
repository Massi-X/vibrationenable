    <string name="dialog_title">Vibration Enable by Massi-X</string>
    <string name="info_text">Vibration Enable is a simple app to restore vibration when the device has battery saver turned on.
        \nBy default when battery saver is \'ON\' vibration will be disabled, I can understand why but if you leave the phone on vibrate mode only you will
        miss everything because the phone will not ring nor vibrate.
        \n
        \nTo fix this simply enable accessibility service for the app, this will be enough to make the phone vibrate again. The accessibility service is only a dummy one,
        no data will be ever collected.
        \n
        \nIf you would like to support my work you can buy one of my other apps, Thank you!
        \nIf you like instead to stop me worrying you with this you can hide the icon ðŸ˜­
