    <string name="info_text">By default Android (up until version 15) disables vibration when battery saver is <b>ON</b>, meaning you will miss calls or other important
        notifications if you set your phone to vibration only.
        \n
        \nVibration Enable restores vibration by using a dummy Accessibility service andâ€¦ that\'s it! This is enough to make the phone vibrate again,
        no data will ever be collected (you can have a look at the source code).
        \n
        \nYou will probably need to enable \"Restricted Settings\" for the app, you can learn more
